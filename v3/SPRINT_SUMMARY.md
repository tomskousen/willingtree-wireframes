## Files Modified

  - Updated routing for 2.1.4, 2.1.5, 2.1.6
  - Changed title "Preparing Good Soil" → "Good Soil"

## Testing Needed
- [ ] Navigate through 2.1.1 → 2.1.7 and toggle between user/partner views
- [ ] Verify MeditateScreen appears at correct stages (2.1.4, 2.1.6 for user; 2.1.5 for partner)
- [ ] Verify Step 5 (5.1.4-5.1.6) shows both partners' screens without meditation
- [ ] Verify sun emoji displays in upper right corner
- [ ] Verify ViewToggle works on all screens

## Known Issues / Questions
1. **2.1.3 Flow**: Confirmed it sends user → partner (already working)
2. **Harvest Screen**: User view confirmed active in 2.1.7
3. **Partner Data Sync**: May need to verify data flows correctly when screens swap

## Next Steps
1. Test all screen flows manually
2. Run Playwright tests
3. Commit if tests pass
