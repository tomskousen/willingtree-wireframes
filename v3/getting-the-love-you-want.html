            <h2>The Big Idea</h2>
            <p>
                We all enter relationships with childhood wounds‚Äîtimes when our needs weren't fully met. Without knowing it, we pick partners who remind us of our caregivers because our brain thinks, "Maybe this time, I can get what I missed."
            </p>
            <p>
                This creates conflict. But here's the good news: <strong>the very conflicts that seem to tear you apart are actually showing you the path to healing and deep connection.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Your Partner is Your Mirror</h2>
            <p>
                When your partner frustrates you, they're often touching an old wound from your childhood. That's why small things can feel so big. You're not just reacting to them forgetting to text you back‚Äîyou're feeling the pain of times you felt ignored or abandoned as a child.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your partner isn't the enemy. They're the messenger showing you where you still need to heal.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>The Imago: Your Unconscious Map</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone carries an "imago"‚Äîan unconscious picture of the perfect partner based on your childhood caregivers. You were drawn to your partner because they matched this picture.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Why this matters:</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    Your partner has traits that both comfort you (they feel familiar) and trigger you (they repeat old wounds). This isn't a mistake‚Äîit's your brain's way of giving you a chance to finally heal those wounds.

            <h2>From Power Struggle to Real Love</h2>
            <p>
                Most relationships go through three stages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Romantic Love</strong> - Everything feels perfect. You see only their good qualities.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Power Struggle</strong> - Reality hits. You fight about who's right and try to change each other.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Real Love</strong> - You accept each other fully and use the relationship to heal and grow together.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Most couples get stuck in the Power Struggle stage and either stay there (unhappy) or give up. But the real magic happens when you push through to stage 3.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>The Behavior Change Request</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of criticizing your partner ("You never listen!"), try this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Describe the behavior:</strong> "When you look at your phone while I'm talking..."</li>
                <li><strong>Share your feeling:</strong> "...I feel unimportant and ignored..."</li>
                <li><strong>Explain the childhood wound:</strong> "...because growing up, my parents were always too busy for me."</li>
                <li><strong>Make a positive request:</strong> "Would you be willing to put your phone away when we talk?"</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
                This approach helps your partner understand <em>why</em> something matters to you, not just <em>what</em> you want.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Intentional Dialogue: The Secret Tool</h2>
            <p>
                When you're upset, instead of arguing, try this three-step process:
            </p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>1. Mirroring</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">
                    Repeat back what your partner said: "So what I'm hearing is..."
                </p>
                <strong>2. Validation</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">
                    Show you understand their perspective: "That makes sense because..."
                </p>
                <strong>3. Empathy</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    Acknowledge their feelings: "I imagine you might be feeling..."
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                This simple tool stops fights from escalating and helps both people feel heard.
            </p>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Stretching: Becoming Your Partner's Healer</h2>
            <p>
                Here's the hard truth: healing happens when your partner gives you what you need, even though it's hard for them. This is called "stretching."
            </p>
            <p>
                If you were ignored as a child and need lots of attention, your partner (who might naturally be independent) has to stretch beyond their comfort zone to give you that attention. And you have to stretch to give them what <em>they</em> need.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>This stretching is where love grows.</strong> You're not just accommodating each other‚Äîyou're actively healing each other's deepest wounds.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Re-romanticizing Your Relationship</h2>
            <p>
                Remember how you used to surprise each other with little gifts and compliments? That wasn't fake‚Äîthat was you instinctively meeting each other's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can bring that back intentionally:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask: "What's one small thing I could do that would make you feel loved?"</li>
                <li>Do one caring behavior every day</li>
                <li>Express appreciation for the things they already do</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                Your relationship problems aren't signs you picked the wrong person. They're invitations to grow.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
                <strong>When you heal your partner's childhood wounds, you heal your own.</strong> When you stretch to meet their needs, they stretch to meet yours. This creates a cycle of mutual healing and ever-deepening love.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 12px;">
                The love you want isn't something you find‚Äîit's something you create together through intentional, conscious partnership.
