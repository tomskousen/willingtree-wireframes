            <h1>üí∞ Gains from Trade in Relationships</h1>
            <p>How economic principles explain why partnerships work</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>What is "Gains from Trade"?</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you're really good at cooking but terrible at fixing things. Your partner is amazing at repairs but hates cooking. If you each did everything yourself, you'd both struggle and spend tons of time on things you're bad at.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you cook for both of you while your partner fixes things for both of you, magic happens: you both eat better food AND have a working house, spending less time and energy overall. That's <strong>gains from trade</strong>‚Äîwhen people swap what they're good at, everyone ends up better off.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>Comparative Advantage: You Don't Have to Be the Best</h2>
            <p>
                Here's the cool part: even if your partner is better at cooking AND fixing things than you are, you can still both benefit from specializing.
            </p>

            <div class="example-box">
                <strong>Example: The Homework Helper</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    Sarah can help with math homework in 20 minutes and clean the kitchen in 40 minutes. Her partner Alex can help with math in 30 minutes and clean the kitchen in 90 minutes. Even though Sarah is faster at both tasks, she's <em>way</em> better at cleaning (saves 50 minutes!) while Alex is only slightly slower at math (10 minutes). So Sarah should clean while Alex helps with homework‚Äîboth tasks get done faster overall.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <strong>Comparative advantage</strong> means you focus on what you're <em>relatively</em> better at, even if you're not the absolute best. It's about what you give up (opportunity cost). When Sarah cleans, she gives up helping with one math session. When Alex helps with math, they give up only part of one cleaning session. That's a good trade!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>How This Applies to Your Relationship</h2>

            <h3>1. Different Costs, Different Strengths</h3>
            <p>
                What feels easy and natural to you might feel draining to your partner, and vice versa. Maybe planning date nights energizes you but exhausts them. Maybe they love handling finances but you find it stressful.
            </p>

            <h3>2. The Opportunity Cost Question</h3>
            <p>
                When you say no to something your partner wants, what are you protecting? What would you have to give up? That's your <strong>opportunity cost</strong>. Understanding this helps you see:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What changes feel manageable (low cost to you, high value to them)</li>
                <li>What changes feel impossible (high cost to you, maybe low value to them)</li>
                <li>Where you might find creative trades that work for both</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="example-box" style="background: #FFF3E0; border-left: 4px solid #FF9800;">
                <strong style="color: #F57C00;">Perspective Matters: Subjective vs. Objective Meaning</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    Philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard taught that meaning exists in two ways: <strong>subjective-toward</strong> (what it means to me personally) and <strong>objective-toward</strong> (what it means in the world). Your partner might assign a completely different cost to the same behavior than you do. What feels like a small sacrifice to you ("just 20 minutes less phone time") might represent a huge loss to them ("my only way to decompress"). And vice versa‚Äîwhat feels enormous to you might seem trivial to them. This misalignment in how you each value the same behavior is often the root of mismatched expectations. Both perspectives are real and valid, even when they're radically different.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Finding the Trades</h3>
            <p>
                The goal isn't for both people to do everything equally. The goal is to find swaps where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You do more of what costs you less</li>
                <li>They do more of what costs them less</li>
                <li>Both of you end up with more of what you value</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>üå≥ Why This Matters for WillingTree</h3>
            <p>
                When you resist a change your partner wants, you're protecting something valuable to you. That's not selfish‚Äîthat's rational. But understanding the <strong>costs and benefits</strong> clearly helps you:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 12px;">
                <li>See which changes are actually cheap for you (low cost, high value to them)</li>
                <li>Explain which changes are expensive for you (so they understand the real trade-off)</li>
                <li>Negotiate creative solutions neither of you thought of initially</li>
                <li>Build a partnership where both people genuinely gain</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">
                Just like in economics, the best relationships aren't about keeping score‚Äîthey're about finding trades where both partners end up better off than if they tried to do everything alone.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Gains from trade:</strong> When you specialize and swap, you both benefit more than working alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Comparative advantage:</strong> Focus on what you're relatively better at, considering what you give up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>In relationships:</strong> Understanding the real costs and benefits of changes helps you find solutions where both people win, instead of fighting over who has to lose.
