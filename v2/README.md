# WillingTree Demo V2 - Changes Summary

## What's New

### 1. Clear Step/Substep Naming Convention

**Old System (Confusing):**
- 1A, 1B, 1B2, 1C, 1D → Hard to understand hierarchy
- 2A, 2B, 2C... → Not clear these are tutorial days
- Mixing between onboarding and features

**New System (Clear):**
- **Step 1: Welcome & Setup** (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- **Step 2: 10-Day Onboarding** (2.1 through 2.10)
- **Step 3: Daily Activities** (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4)
- **Step 4: Branch Building** (4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
- **Step 5: Partner Interaction** (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5)

### 2. No Scrolling Within Phone Frame

**Optimizations Made:**
- Reduced header from ~80px to 50px (saved 30px vertical space)
- Compact form fields (10px padding instead of 15px)
- Smaller margins and gaps (16px instead of 24px)
- Shorter text descriptions (removed verbose explanations)
- Smaller button text (14px instead of 16px)
- Compact checkboxes and cards

**Result:** All content fits within 667px viewport height without scrolling

### 3. Better Visual Organization

- Each step has a clear color-coded section in navigation
- Screen labels show step.substep (e.g., "2.5" instead of "2E")
- Navigation panel groups related screens together
- Easier to understand the overall flow
